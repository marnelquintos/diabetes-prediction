# DIABETES PREDICTOR

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use machine learning to predict if a patient is either diabetic or nondiabetic. The dataset to train my model is obtained from Kaggle 
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset) which I cleaned to only use variables glucose, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, age, and outcome. 
I created this to be a logistic regression model which is a type of supervised learning, to classify if the patient is either diabetic or nondiabetic. Lastly, I created a bar chart, 
histogram, and a confusion matrix to visualize the relationships between the data set variables.

## How it Works
The ipynb was created in a Jupyter Notebook. Once ran, there is an interactive widget at the bottom that can be used where the user 
will use sliders to input the desired values of the variables and my model will classify if the patient is either diabetic or nondiabetic.
